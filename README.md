# 🛠️ Current Research—Digital Phenotyping and Structural Modeling of Fruit Trees Based on Ground-Based LiDAR


This research aims to construct high-precision 3D structural models of fruit trees using ground-based LiDAR, develop algorithms for tree structure parameter extraction, point cloud semantic segmentation, and pruning point recognition, and realize a complete system workflow from point cloud acquisition, structural modeling, model training to pruning decision output.

The ultimate goal is to establish an intelligent fruit tree structure understanding system applicable to natural orchard scenarios, providing key algorithmic support for digital orchard management and intelligent pruning equipment.

Current research focuses on:

• LiDAR-based point cloud preprocessing and structural analysis of fruit trees

• Automatic branch segmentation and canopy structure parameter extraction

• Construction of a deep learning model for point cloud semantic segmentation

• Development of an automatic pruning point recognition and decision-making model
